            <h2>1. Butter Chicken</h2>
            <img src="butter0.jpg" alt="Butter Chicken">
            <p>Ingredients: 
<p>Chicken, tomato, butter, cream, spices.</p>
            <p>Instructions: If using bone-in chicken thighs, make 2 to 3 deep gashes in the chicken; skip this if you use the boneless pieces.</p>
<p>Place all the ingredients for the marinade in a medium bowl or ziptop bag and combine until smooth. Fold in the chicken and make sure the chicken is completely coated with the marinade. Leave in the refrigerator covered for 1 hour, preferably overnight.</p>
<p>When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 400F/200C.</p>
<p>Lay the marinated chicken pieces out on a baking dish or roasting pan. Roast the chicken in the oven until the internal temperature reaches 164F/74C, 30 to 45 minutes (boneless chicken takes about 20 minutes), rotating the dish halfway through during cooking. Transfer the baking dish to the upper rack of the oven, and then broil over high for 2 to 4 minutes, until the chicken starts to char in a few spots. Remove the baking dish from the oven.</p>
<p>At the 20-minute mark of cooking the chicken, start the sauce. Melt the butter in a medium Dutch oven or saucepan over low heat. Once the butter begins to foam, stir in the oil. Add the Kashmiri chilli powder, toasted cumin, garlic, ginger, garam masala, and green chilli. Stir until fragrant, 30 to 45 seconds. Then add the tomato paste and cook until the paste begins to turn light brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Pour in the heavy cream and add the chicken and any liquids left behind in the baking dish. Fold to coat well. Stir in the lemon juice, taste, and season with salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high; the fat should separate from the sauce. Remove from the heat. Garnish with cilantro and salted butter if using. Serve hot or warm with rice or naan. Leftovers will stay good for up to 3 days if stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator.</p>

            <h2>2. Biryani</h2>
            <img src="biriyani.jpg" alt="Biryani">
            <p>Ingredients: Basmati rice, meat (chicken or mutton), spices.</p>
            <p>Instructions: 
<p>Soak 300g basmati rice in warm water, then wash in cold until the water runs clear.</p>

<p>Heat 25g butter in a saucepan and cook 1 finely sliced large onion with 1 bay leaf, 3 cardamom pods and 1 small cinnamon stick for 10 mins.</p>

<p>Sprinkle in 1 tsp turmeric, then add 4 chicken breasts, cut into large chunks, and 4 tbsp curry paste. Cook until aromatic.</p>

<p>Stir the rice into the pan with 85g raisins, then pour over 850ml chicken stock.</p>

<p>Place a tight-fitting lid on the pan and bring to a hard boil, then lower the heat to a minimum and cook the rice for another 5 mins.</p>

<p>Turn off the heat and leave for 10 mins. Stir well, mixing through 15g chopped coriander. To serve, scatter over the leaves of the remaining 15g coriander and 2 tbsp toasted almonds.</p>

            <h2>3. Paneer Tikka</h2>
            <img src="tik.jpg" alt="Paneer Tikka">
            <p>Ingredients: Paneer, yogurt, spices.</p>
            <p>Instructions: 
<p>In a bowl, mix the yoghurt, spices, lemon juice, ginger, garlic and mustard seed oil. Then add the chopped paneer, onion and capsicums to the yoghurt mix to marinate for at least 30 minutes but 3 hours would be better.</p>
<p>Once they are marinated, skewer the paneer and veggies, and grill over medium-high heat (preferably over charcoal) until cooked through and slightly charred.</p>
<p>Serve hot with a wedge of lemon or your favourite dipping sauce, I love it with lime pickle. Enjoy!</p>

            <h2>4. Masala Dosa</h2>
            <img src="dosa.jpg" alt="Masala Dosa">
            <p>Ingredients: Rice batter, potatoes, spices.</p>
            <p>Instructions: 
<p>Make the dosa batter: Put rice in a bowl, rinse well and cover with 4 cups cold water. Put urad dal and fenugreek seeds in a small bowl, rinse well and add cold water to cover. Leave both to soak for 4 to 6 hours.</p>

<p>Drain rice and dal-fenugreek mixture in separate colanders. Put rice in a food processor, blender or wet-dry grinder. Add 1 cup cold water and grind to a smooth paste. It will take about 10 minutes, and it may be necessary to work in batches. Repeat the process with the dal-fenugreek mixture.</p>

<p>Combine the two pastes in a medium mixing bowl. Whisk together, adding enough water to obtain a medium-thick batter. You should have about 6 cups. Cover bowl with a kitchen towel and set in a warm place. Let ferment until the surface is bubbly, about 8 hours. Stir in the salt. Use the batter straight away or refrigerate for later use. (Batter will keep for up to a week, refrigerated. Thin with water if necessary before proceeding.</p>

<p>Make the potato filling: Put ghee in a wide skillet over medium heat. When oil is wavy, add mustard seeds and cumin seeds. Wait for seeds to pop, about 1 minute, then add red peppers and onion. Cook, stirring until onions have softened, about 5 minutes. Season lightly with salt. Add turmeric, asafetida, ginger, curry leaves, garlic and green chile. Stir to coat and let sizzle for 1 minute.</p>

<p>Add potatoes and ½ cup water. Cook, stirring well to combine, until liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Mash potatoes a bit with the back of a wooden spoon. Season well with salt, add cilantro, then set aside at room temperature. (Potato filling may be prepared up to a day in advance.</P>

<p>To make dosas, set a griddle or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Brush with about 1 teaspoon vegetable oil. Ladle ¼ cup batter in the center of griddle. Using bottom of ladle, quickly spread batter outward in a circular motion to a diameter of about 7 inches. Drizzle ½ teaspoon oil over the top. Leave dosa batter to brown gradually until outer edges begin to look dry, about 2 minutes, cooking on one side only. With a spatula, carefully loosen dosa from griddle. Bottom should be crisp and beautifully browned. Spoon ½ cup potato filling onto top of dosa, centering it as a strip in the middle of the round dosa. Flatten the potato mixture slightly. Using the spatula, fold the sides of the dosa around the filling to make a cylindrical shape. Serve immediately. Continue making dosas one at a time.</p>

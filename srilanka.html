            <h2>1. Kottu Roti</h2>
            <img src="kottu.jpg" alt="Kottu Roti">
            <p>Ingredients: Roti, vegetables, chicken, spices.</p>
            <p>Instructions: Kottu roti is made with a type of flatbread called “Godhambara roti” or “Godamba roti” (which is also called roti canai, which originates from Malaysia, or the flakier cousin – paratha, from India), that is shredded and then mixed with vegetables, meat and eggs (or not, for a vegetarian or vegan option) and aromatic spices and sauces.</p>

<p>The whole mix is then chopped and mixed together on a large flat griddle with two large steel chopping blades, which produces that characteristic sound and the theatrics of making kottu roti. A lot of street vendors will also have their very own beat and rhythm when using those blades, which make for a very tasty as well entertaining dish! It’s the Sri Lankan version of “dubstep teppanyaki”!</p>

            <h2>2. Hoppers</h2>
            <img src="appa.jpg" alt="Hoppers">
            <p>Ingredients: Rice flour, coconut milk, yeast.</p>
            <p>Instructions: <p>The day before, soak the two cups of uncooked (raw) rice in enough water for at least 5 hours (or overnight).</p>

<p>Just before you are ready to process the rice, prepare the yeast mixture by stirring together together the yeast and sugar in the lukewarm water and set aside.</p>

<p>In a food processor, process the cooked rice, grated coconut and yeast mixture until thoroughly blended.</p>

<p>Drain the soaked rice of its soaking water.</p>

<p>Place the drained, soaked rice and salt into the food processor containing the cooked rice and coconut yeast mixture and blend.</p>

<p>Whilst the mixture in the food processor continues to blend, add the lukewarm water a little at a time until the whole cup of water has been added. Keep processing until you get a smooth batter, which may take about up to 10 mins.</p>

<p>Transfer the smooth batter into a large bowl, loosely covering it with a tea towel, and leave in a warm place to ferment for 8 hours*. The batter will have bloomed to about 3 times its original size.</p>

<p>When you are ready to cook the hoppers, stir enough coconut milk into the fermented batter make it the consistency of pancake batter (and not too thin consistency). Finally add the sugar and stir. </p>

<p>If your hopper pan** is a conventional metal one (i.e. not a non-stick pan), you will need to season it first so that the hoppers don’t stick to it once they are cooked.</p>

<p>Heat the hopper pan on a medium-high heat until you can feel that heat penetrating through the middle of the pan.</p>

<p>Dab a scrunched paper towel with a little sesame oil and wipe around the inside of the pan to place a thin layer of oil on it. You will need to wipe the pan this way and keep it oiled before each time addition of the batter.</p>

<p>Hold the hopper pan with your left hand. Using a soup ladle with your right hand, scoop the batter into the ladle and pour it into the near centre of the hopper pan. Lift the hopper pan off the stove and swirl it around so that the batter covers the pan***. Once you have done this, place the pan back on the stove and cover the hopper pan with its lid to cook.</p>

<p>Cook the hopper for about 2.5 to 3 mins on medium-high to allow the bowl structure of the hopper to form. Reduce the temperature of the stove to medium and cook for another minute this gives time for the final steaming of the centre without burning the overall hopper.</p>

<p>Once cooked^ the hopper should slide out of the hopper pan almost without any assistance.</p>

<p>If you’re making egg hoppers, simply crack an egg into the centre of the swirled batter (use slightly less than a ladle spoonful) in the pan and season with salt and pepper before placing the lid on. Cook for about 4 mins on medium-high and turn down to medium for another minute (or until the egg has just become white / set on its whole surface).</p>

            <h2>3. Pol Sambol</h2>
            <img src="pol.png" alt="Pol Sambol">
            <p>Ingredients: Coconut, chili, onion, lime.</p>
            <p>Instructions: <p>Using fresh coconut will taste the best, but frozen coconut also works in this recipe. In the US, shredded coconut can be found in the frozen section of any asian grocery store. Make sure you buy the ‘shredded’ and not ‘chunks’ of frozen coconut</p>
<p>Adding a garlic clove is optional in this recipe since it adds some heat and garlicky taste to the Pol Sambola. Omit completely if you are not a fan of garlic.</p>
<p>Adding a small tomato (or a few cherry tomatoes) is options in this recipe. Adding tomatoes will make the pol sambol more moist and sour. Add less lemon juice if adding tomatoes.</p>
<p>Substitute the red pearl onions with about half or quarter of a regular onion (red). White onions do not add flavor to any sambola dish, so they are not recommended to use in this recipe</p>
<p>Whole red chilies can be substituted for red chillie flakes. Cut the whole red chilies into smaller pieces and grind in the mortar and pestle. To lessen the heat, remove the seeds first before grinding.</p>
<P>Red chilli flakes can also be substituted with red chili powder. Note that the flavor will change a bit.</p>
<p>No mortar and pestle? No problem! Just mix all the ingredients by hand. Definitely use red chili powder in this case, since it is much easier to mix that chili flakes.</p>
<p>Maldive fish flakes (also called Umalakada) is a traditional sri lankan condiment added to pol sambol, which gives it an umami  taste. Please omit if you are vegetarian/vegan. Pol sambol still tastes great without maldive fish flakes.</p>

            <h2>4. Fish Ambul Thiyal</h2>
            <img src="fish.jpg" alt="Fish Ambul Thiyal">
            <p>Ingredients: Fish, Goraka, spices.</p>
            <p>Instructions: <p>Clean the fish ,and wash it with salt and turmeric.</p>
</p>Cut the goraka into small pieces and soak in half a cup of water for 10 to 15 minutes</p>
<p>Dry roast the pepper and fenugreek seeds</p>
<p>In a mixer jar add all the ingredients except fish, whole garam masala  and curry leaves and  grind to a nice paste.</p>
<p>Add a handful of curry leaves finally and pulse it once or twice</p>
<p>Take a clay pot and line with banana leaf. (I omitted this coz I did not have banana leaf). Strew a few curry leaves on it. Coat the fish well with the ground paste, and arrange in a single layer, on the banana leaf in a way that every fish piece touches the bottom of the pot.</p>
<p>Pour over the remaining paste and add necessary water to immerse all the fish pieces. Mix it over without disturbing the fish pieces. Marinate for about an hour.</p>
<p>After marinating add the whole garam masala , jaggery, and the remaining curry leaves on the top. Close the vessel and cook till boiling point. You can check spices at this point and add chilly powder or salt to balance the tanginess.</p>
<p>Simmer it for about 30-45 minutes till all the water gets dried up. As we prefer a little bit of gravy with the fish I normally switch it off before it dries out completely.</p>
<p>Serve with plain white rice or Kiribath.</p>
